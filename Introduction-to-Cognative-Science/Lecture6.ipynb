    "\n",
    "Neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI, provide valuable insights into cognitive activity. However, there are certain limitations and challenges associated with these techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Indirect Measures of Cognitive Activity: Neuroimaging techniques like fMRI do not directly measure cognitive activity. Instead, they measure changes in blood flow, which are assumed to correlate with neural activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Noisy fMRI Data:\n",
    "    - Small Voxels: Small voxels provide higher resolution but weaker signals, making it harder to detect activity.\n",
    "    - Large Voxels: Large voxels assume uniformity in brain tissue, which may not always be accurate, potentially missing finer details.\n",
    "    - Normalization Issues: Aligning individual brains to a standard template can cause distortions due to anatomical differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional Connectivity vs. Effective Connectivity:\n",
    "    - Functional Connectivity: This approach looks at correlations between different brain regions' activities, indicating regions that are functionally related.\n",
    "    - Effective Connectivity: This approach examines causal relationships, identifying how information flows between regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these problems and pitfalls is crucial for interpreting neuroimaging data accurately and drawing meaningful conclusions."
