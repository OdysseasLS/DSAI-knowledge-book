    "# Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayesianism is built on three basic ideas:\n",
    "1. Belief comes in degrees.\n",
    "2. Degrees of belief can be modeled as probabilities, which means that they have to conform to the basic principles of the probability calculus.\n",
    "3. Learning takes place by updating probabilities according to Bayes‚Äôs Rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes‚Äôs Rule\n",
    "Bayes‚Äôs Rule is a tool for measuring the posterior probability of a hypothesis, conditional upon some evidence:\n",
    "1. Bayes‚Äôs Rule is calculated from the prior probability of the hypothesis, p(H), the likelihood of the evidence, given the hypothesis, p(E/H), and the probability of the evidence, p(E).\n",
    "2. According to Bayes‚Äôs Rule, \n",
    "\n",
    "   $\\text{ the posterior probability of the hypothesis =  } \\frac{\\text{Likelihood of the evidence} \\times \\text{Prior probability of the hypothesis}}{\\text{Probability of the evidence} } $\n",
    "3. Bayes‚Äôs Rule is a straightforward consequence of the definition of conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perception\n",
    "Perception can be modeled in terms of Bayesian inference.\n",
    "1. Perceptual systems have the job of selecting between different hypotheses about the layout of the distal environment on the basis of noisy and partial data (the evidence).\n",
    "2. This process can be modeled as an application of Bayes‚Äôs Rule, because ultimately perceptual systems have to decide which hypothesis has the highest posterior probability, conditional upon the evidence coming from the senses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binocular Rivalry (Two eyes Competition)\n",
    "Binocular rivalry offers a case study in Bayesian approaches to perception.\n",
    "1. When separate images are presented to each eye, the percept generated by the visual system alternates between the two images, seemingly at random.\n",
    "2. From a Bayesian perspective, this is an understandable response to the posterior probabilities calculated via Bayes‚Äôs Rule.\n",
    "3. The posterior probability for the hypothesis corresponding to the left image (conditional upon the evidence) is the same as the posterior probability for the right image hypothesis, and both are higher than the posterior probability for the hypothesis that the environment contains a composite corresponding to a blend of the two images.\n",
    "4. Since the posterior probabilities for the left and right hypotheses are equal, the visual system can‚Äôt decide between them, and so simply alternates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Utility\n",
    "Expected utility is the key concept for applying Bayesianism to practical decision-making.\n",
    "1. Utility is a measure of how much a decision-maker values a particular outcome.\n",
    "2. To calculate the expected utility of an action you need to assign utilities to its different possible outcomes and then sum those utilities together, each discounted by the probability that it will occur.\n",
    "3. The St Petersburg game shows that expected utility is not necessarily the same as expected monetary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neuroeconomics: Bayes in the Brain\n",
    "Platt and Glimcher‚Äôs experiments recording single neurons in the parietal cortex of the monkey are an illustration from neuroeconomics of how the brain may apply Bayesian principles.\n",
    "1. Neuroeconomics is located at the interface between neuroscience, microeconomics, the psychology of reasoning, behavioral finance, and decision theory.\n",
    "2. Platt and Glimcher studied how individual neurons in LIP responded while monkeys made saccadic eye movements for fruit juice rewards.\n",
    "3. Holding all other aspects of the task constant, but varying the probability that each response would be rewarded revealed that the firing rates of individual neurons correlates with both the prior and posterior probabilities of reward.\n",
    "4. Holding all aspects of the task constant, but varying the quantity of the reward revealed that the firing rates of individual neurons correlates with the value of the reward (an analog of utility).\n",
    "5. Using a free-choice version of the cued saccade task revealed neurons firing according to the estimated value to the animal of a particular response (as calculated according to Herrnstein‚Äôs melioration theory, which differs from but is related to expected utility theory).\n"
