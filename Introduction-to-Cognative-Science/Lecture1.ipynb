    "\n",
    "**1. Even very basic types of behavior (such as the behavior of rats in mazes) seem to involve storing and processing information about the environment:**\n",
    "- Experiments by Tolman and Honzik (1930) and Tolman, Ritchie, and Kalish (1946) demonstrated that rats form cognitive maps and engage in latent learning, indicating that even simple organisms process and store environmental information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Information relevant to cognition can take many forms – from information about the environment to information about how sentences can be constructed and transformed:**\n",
    "- Cognitive science studies diverse types of information, such as spatial layouts in Tolman's experiments and linguistic structures in Chomsky's transformational grammar. These forms of information are crucial for understanding different cognitive abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Perceptual systems can be viewed as information channels and we can study both: (a) the very general properties of those channels (e.g., their channel capacity) (b) the way in which information flows through those channels:**\n",
    "- **George Miller (1956):** Proposed limits on human information processing capacity, conceptualizing sensory systems as channels with finite capacity.\n",
    "- **Donald Broadbent (1958):** Developed models illustrating how information flows through sensory channels, with selective filtering and limited capacity stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Mathematical logic and the theory of computation show us how information processing can be mechanical and algorithmic:**\n",
    "- **Alan Turing (1936-7):** Demonstrated that information processing can be understood as a series of algorithmic steps, executed mechanically by Turing machines, establishing a foundational model for computational theories of the mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Much of the information-processing that goes on in the mind takes place below the threshold of awareness:**\n",
    "- **Karl Lashley (1951):** Highlighted that complex behaviors and planning often occur without conscious awareness, involving hierarchical and subconscious information-processing mechanisms.\n",
    "- The idea that cognitive processes, such as those studied by Miller and Broadbent, operate beneath conscious awareness, performing tasks like filtering sensory inputs or managing memory without explicit attention.\n",
