	\section{Physical Symbol System Hypothesis}
	Why are humans are the only species to have created intricate symbol systems such as language, music, mathematics, and geometry.\\
	Individual sciences have their building blocks that govern that science. In the case of AI/Cognitive Science the building blocks are symbols.\\
	To creating building blocks is to assign symbols (internal or external) to any concept and vice-versa.\\
	There are various languages to the human brain, such as normal languages, mathematics, musics, symbolic, etc...\\
	The PSS Hypothesis says that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.\\
	Symbols are physical patterns such as numbers, letters, ink on paper, air waves, etc...\\
	Symbols can be combined to form complex symbol structures.\\
	The system contains processes for manipulating complex symbol structures.\\
	The process for representing complex symbol structures can themselves be symbolically represented.\\
	Symbols can be designated to reference other symbols inside or outside the same system.\\
	A PSS can interpret an expression of symbols to carry out instructions.\\
	
	\newpage
	\section{Classical Cognitive Science}
	Endorses the PSS Hypothesis, it is inspired by digital computers. It implies that cognition is a rule-governed symbol manipulation.\\
	Functionalism means implementation equivalence?\\
	\subsection{Language of thought}
	The human mind works as a PSS.\\
	The mental representation allows us to generate more complex symbol combinations.\\
	The mind is structured like a formal language, mentalese, which is a pre-linguistic language independent of normal languages. It is the language that forms your thoughts.\\
	Core sentences in mentalese are propositional attitudes such as beliefs and desires that have intentional states and are about something.\\
	\subsection{What king of PSS is the mind?}
	Compositionality, complex thoughts are made up of smaller elements.\\
	Productivity, one is able to generate novel thoughts because the system has virtually unbounded power due to combinatorial nature.\\
	Logical structure, relationships between internal representations in the system which relate to the external properties of the world, there are also syntactic rules that govern and operate the sentences formed using the symbols.\\
	
	\newpage
	\section{Predicate Calculus}
	First Order Logic.?\\
	The meaning of symbols can be abstract and the meaning is not determined by a set of purely physical criteria.\\
	Role filler independence the semantic content of the predicate is invariant with respect to its arguments, meaning that its base meaning should not change.\\
	To abstract to note down.
	
	\section{Evidence for Language of Thought}
	Spatial navigation, the hippocampus builds a cognitive map of the environment that holds information about places in the organism's environment, their relations, and the existence of objects  within it.
