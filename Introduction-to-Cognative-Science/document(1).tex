	\section{The turn to the brain}
	We know a lot about the brain in terms of structure and behavior, but we do not know how the physical processes translate into cognition.\\
	\subsection{Behavior and the brain}
	Phrenology is the idea that the structure of the skull we can deduce mental abilities. We now know that certain parts of the brain specialize in certain tasks but are not independent.\\
	Dualism is the belief that humans consist of a material body that can be studied and an immaterial soul that cannot be studied, this was common place before the 18th century when philosophy and religion were strongly intertwined.\\
	Cartesian dualism is the belief that the soul interacts with the body.\\
	Materialism is the belief that there is no such thing as a soul and everything is based in material and physical processes.
	\subsection{History of psychiatry}
	Began with madhouses, evolved into lobotomy.\\
	Lobotomy is the act of removing part of the frontal lobe of a patient's brain in order to reduce psychiatric symptoms. This surgery involved drilling into the skull, the procedure can be done with an ice-pick between the eye and nose while the patient is sedated with electric shock therapy.\\
	Clinical neuropsychology, damage to different areas of the brain lead to different symptoms.\\
	The brain is made of two spheres that are connected through the corpus callosum, the outer part is called the cerebral cortex, the hemispheres are symmetrical in sensory and motor functions but lateralized (not for sound).\\
	Action potentials are binary in nature and their amplitude can't be modulated but their frequency can, thus strong signals lead to higher firing frequencies.

	\subsection{Specific brain impairments}
	Aphasia is a deficit in speech production or comprehension and it is most often caused by stroke or head trauma. Non-fluent aphasia has difficulty talking but have meaning sentences, fluent aphasia doesn't have difficulty talking but their sentences don't make any sense and they don't notice.\\
	Split brain patients are people who have their corpus callosum removed and thus have no communication between the right and left hemispheres.\\
	Visual agnosia is the inability to name shown objects despite the ability to recognize them otherwise.\\
	Blind-sight is a phenomena of having ability to respond to visual stimuli despite blindness.\\
	Prosopagnosia is an impairment in face recognition. This condition is mostly acquired after brain damage.
	\subsection{Measuring the brain}
	Electroencephalography (EEG), a grid of electrodes placed around the scalp that detect voltage fluctuations in the brain.\\
	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and radio waves that produce signals that can be picked up with sensors, it is highly spatial but low temporal resolution.\\
	Brain activity is more predictive of actual behavior than self-reported intentions.
