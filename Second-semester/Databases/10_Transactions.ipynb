    "Deadlock Prevention with Timestamps: This strategy assigns priorities to transactions based on their timestamps. If a transaction (Tx1) wants a lock held by another transaction (Tx2), Tx2 will abort if Tx1 has a higher priority. Otherwise, Tx1 waits. When a transaction restarts, it retains its original timestamp.\n",

    "Alternatives to Strict 2PL:\n",
    "- Conservative 2PL: This approach acquires all locks at the beginning of a transaction and releases them at the end. It ensures conflict serializability and prevents deadlocks but is not very efficient due to limited concurrency.\n",
    "- Simple 2PL: Locks are acquired immediately before an action and released immediately after the object is no longer needed. It's time-efficient with high concurrency but may require cascading aborts, violating ACID properties.\n",
    "- Optimistic Scheduling: Transactions do not lock objects. Instead, conflict serializability is checked through a precedence graph, and transactions may be rolled back and rescheduled when conflicts occur. It's efficient for mostly independent transactions but can become inefficient with concurrent processing of the same objects.\n",
