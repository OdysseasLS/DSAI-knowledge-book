    "Breadth-first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used for searching a graph layer-wise starting from a given vertex. It explores all the nearest nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This algorithm is implemented using a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Start with a given vertex `v` and mark it as visited.\n",
    "2. Enqueue vertex `v`.\n",
    "3. While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "   - Dequeue a vertex `u` from the queue.\n",
    "   - For each adjacent vertex `w` of `u` that has not been visited:\n",
    "     - Mark `w` as visited.\n",
    "     - Enqueue `w`.\n",
    "4. Continue the process until the queue is empty.\n",
