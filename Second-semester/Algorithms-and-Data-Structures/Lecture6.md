## Backtracking
Natural problem-solving heuristic.To reduce the state-space, especially useful when working with exponentially large problems.
### Hamiltonian Circuit with Backtracking
- Generate paths step by step, ensuring each vertex is visited once. If a path cannot be extended, backtrack to try another path.
