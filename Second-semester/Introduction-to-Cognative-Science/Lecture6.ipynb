    "#### **The principle of segregation** It is a basic principle of neuroscience that the cerebral cortex is divided into seprated areas with distinct neuronal populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These different regions are distinguished in terms of the types of cell they contain, the density of those cells and their functionality by techniques like tract tracing or diffusion tractography.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The principle of integration**: cognitive functioning involves the coordinated activity of networks of different brain areas\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neuroimaging is a very powerful tool for studying cognition but neuroimaging data should be interpreted with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroimaging techniques can only measure cognitive activity indirectly. There is a controversy in neuroscience about what type of neural activity is correlated with the BOLD signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many opportunities for noise to get into the system in neuroimaging experiments. Partial volume effects can occur when the voxel size is large, and distortions ( Wrong derivated data ) can occur when data are being normalized to allow comparison across subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroimaging techniques are much better at telling us about functional connectivity (correlations between activation levels in different brain areas as a task is performed) than about effective connectivity (how information flows between different brain areas and how they influence each other)."
