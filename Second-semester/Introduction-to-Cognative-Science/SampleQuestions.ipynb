    "# Answers\n",
    "### 1\n",
    "**Answer:** Its surface structure  \n",
    "**Explanation:** The surface structure of a sentence refers to its syntactic form, the arrangement of words and phrases. Symbolizing a sentence with grammatical symbols (like NP1 + Aux + V + NP2) describes its syntactic arrangement rather than its meaning or deep structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\n",
    "**Answer:** True  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Shepard and Kosslyn suggested that the mental representation of visual information (imagistic encoding) involves processing time that depends on the complexity of the information. This implies that more complex images take longer to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\n",
    "**Answer:** False  \n",
    "**Explanation:** SHRDLU is designed to understand and respond to commands in a micro-world by dealing with the semantics of language. It interprets the meanings of words and sentences within a limited domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\n",
    "**Answer:** Forebrain  \n",
    "**Explanation:** The cerebral cortex is a part of the forebrain. It is responsible for higher brain functions, including sensation, voluntary muscle movement, thought, reasoning, and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5\n",
    "**Answer:** True  \n",
    "**Explanation:** The visual system processes information contra-laterally, meaning that the left visual field is processed by the right hemisphere and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6\n",
    "**Answer:** Event-related design  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Event-related designs are used in fMRI studies to measure brain activity in response to specific events or stimuli, making them suitable for short duration tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7\n",
    "**Answer:** Propositional attitudes  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Propositional attitudes are mental states that involve a relationship between a person and a proposition, such as beliefs, desires, hopes, and fears.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8\n",
    "**Answer:** Behaviorists study non-psychological observable phenomena and measurable behavior, while cognitive science is the study of cognition and mind.  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Behaviorism focuses on observable behavior and external stimuli, while cognitive science emphasizes internal mental processes and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9\n",
    "**Answer:** True  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Broadbent's filter model of attention proposes that information processing involves channels through which sensory inputs are filtered before reaching higher cognitive processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10\n",
    "**Answer:** Two different types of conditioning, both exploiting mechanisms of association and reinforcement.  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Both reinforcement learning and classical conditioning involve learning through associations and reinforcement, but they differ in their specific mechanisms and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11\n",
    "**Answer:** How we consciously experience mental images.  \n",
    "**Explanation:** The imagery debate focuses on the nature of mental images and how they are experienced and processed by the mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12\n",
    "**Answer:** Autistic children  \n",
    "**Explanation:** These experiments showed that autistic children can pass false belief tasks, indicating an understanding of others' beliefs despite generally having social cognitive deficits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13\n",
    "**Answer:** SAM (the shared attention mechanism)  \n",
    "**Explanation:** SAM is thought to develop early and allows infants to share attention with others, a precursor to more complex mindreading abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14\n",
    "**Answer:** Vision for action  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Goodale and Milner's model distinguishes between vision for perception (conscious) and vision for action (often unconscious, guiding motor movements).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15\n",
    "**Answer:** They typically do not initiate movements towards objects in the regions of their visual field where they lack conscious awareness.  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Blindsight and neglect patients lack conscious awareness in certain visual fields but can sometimes respond to stimuli in those areas unconsciously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16\n",
    "**Answer:** Both of the above  \n",
    "**Explanation:** A knowledge base includes a collection of true things about our universe and the set of propositions that a person considers to be true.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 20\n",
    "**Answer:** True  \n",
    "**Explanation:** This error occurs when children apply regular grammatical rules to irregular verbs, indicating their understanding and application of linguistic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 21\n",
    "**Answer:** True  \n",
    "**Explanation:** The size principle suggests that specific, narrow hypotheses are preferred over broad ones when the evidence supports them, aiding in category learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 22\n",
    "**Answer:** A symbolic representation of the rule that the past tense is formed by adding the suffix “-ed” to the stem of the verb  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 28\n",
    "**Answer:** Explaining the feeling of particular experiences  \n",
    "**Explanation:** The easy problems involve explaining cognitive functions and mechanisms, while the hard problem involves explaining subjective experiences (qualia).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29\n",
    "**Answer:** In the pattern of weights holding across individual units  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Information in neural networks is stored in the weights of connections between units, which are adjusted during learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30\n",
    "**Answer:** True  \n",
    "**Explanation:** Different activation functions can lead to different outputs even with the same inputs, due to the varying ways they process the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
