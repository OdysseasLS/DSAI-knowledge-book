    "1. **The symbols are physical patterns.**\n",

    "2. **Physical symbols can be combined to form complex symbol structures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Physical symbol systems contain processes for manipulating complex symbol structures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The processes for manipulating complex symbol structures can be represented by symbols and structures within the system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Problems are solved by generating and modifying symbol structures until a solution structure is reached.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The physical symbol system hypothesis is very programmatic. Fodor’s language of thought hypothesis is one way of turning the physical symbol system hypothesis into a concrete proposal about how the mind works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The language of thought hypothesis is grounded in intentional realism. Psychological states such as belief and desire are real physical entities. These entities are sentences in the language of thought.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The hypothesis offers a way of explaining causation by content (i.e., how physical representations can have causal effects in the world as a function of how they represent the world).**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fodor suggests that we understand the relation between sentences in the language of thought and their contents on the model of the relation between syntax and semantics in a formal system.**\n",
    "   - The relationship between the structure of these mental sentences (syntax) and their meaning (semantics) is akin to formal logical systems where syntactic rules preserve semantic truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The syntax of the language of thought tracks its semantics because the language of thought is a formal language with analogs of the formal properties of soundness and completeness.**"
