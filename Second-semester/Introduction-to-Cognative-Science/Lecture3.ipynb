    "\n",
    "Ungerleider and Mishkin’s Two Visual Systems Hypothesis\n",
    "1. The cross-lesion disconnection paradigm, coupled with various other anatomical and neurological methods, was used to identify two different information-processing pathways for visual information.\n",
    "2. Both pathways start from the primary visual cortex.\n",
    "3. Information relevant to object identification and recognition travels along the ventral pathway, from the primary visual cortex to the inferior temporal cortex via the prestriate cortex.\n",
    "4. Information relevant to locating objects flows from the primary visual cortex to the posterior parietal lobe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Processing in Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "1. These networks are designed to reflect certain high-level features of how the brain processes information, such as its parallel and distributed nature.\n",
    "2. The neuron-like units in artificial neural networks are organized into layers, with no connections between units in a single layer.\n",
    "3. The overall behavior of the network is determined by the weights attached to the connections between pairs of units in adjacent layers.\n",
    "4. Networks \"learn\" by adjusting the weights in order to reduce error.\n",
    "5. Artificial neural networks are particularly suited to pattern recognition tasks, such as discriminating sonar echoes caused by mines from those caused by rocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Neuroimaging: PET and the Example of Single-Word Processing\n",
    "1. PET allows brain activity to be studied noninvasively by measuring blood flow in the brain while subjects are performing particular cognitive tasks.\n",
    "2. The paired-subtraction paradigm focuses on the brain activity specific to the task by subtracting out the activity generated by carefully chosen control tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Neuroimaging: Event-Related fMRI and Predicting How Well Visual Experiences Will Be Remembered\n",
    "1. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures levels of blood oxygen in the brain (the BOLD contrast/signal), and has superseded PET as a neuroimaging tool for many applications.\n",
    "2. Event-related fMRI allows researchers to study the BOLD signal associated with individual neural events, unlike the blocked-design standard used in PET imaging.\n",
    "3. Event-related fMRI works because, even though the BOLD response is delayed and takes time to develop, it behaves in a linear manner that allows a cumulative BOLD signal derived from multiple individual events to be broken down into its constituent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Correlates of the BOLD Signal\n",
    "1. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a measure of blood flow in terms of levels of blood oxygenation (the BOLD signal), giving an index of cognitive activity.\n",
    "2. This raises the question of how this cognitive activity is related to neural activity.\n",
    "3. One possibility is that cognitive activity detected by fMRI is correlated with the outputs of populations of neurons (as manifested in their firing activity). Another possibility is that the correlation is with the input to populations of neurons (as measured by the local field potential).\n",
    "4. The experiments of Logothetis and his collaborators seem to show that the correlation is with the input to neural areas, rather than with their output.\n"
