    "## Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge of Consciousness\n",
    "1. We can take either a first-person or a third-person approach to consciousness.\n",
    "2. Jackson’s Knowledge Argument illustrates the contrast between the first-person and third-person approaches to consciousness.\n",
    "3. According to the Knowledge Argument, a color blind scientist who knew every (third-person) scientific fact about consciousness would still lack a crucial piece of knowledge – first-person knowledge of what it is like to see color.\n",
    "4. The contrast between the first- and third-person approaches points to the potential inadequacy of cognitive science for studying consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Processing without Conscious Awareness\n",
    "1. There are two primary ways of understanding unconscious information processing: priming experiments and studies of patients with neurological damage.\n",
    "2. Semantic priming studies show that basic categorization can be accomplished unconsciously. Since semantic categorization is generally thought to be nonmodular, these tasks also suggest that there can be nonmodular unconscious processing.\n",
    "3. Blindsight and unilateral (One-way) neglect indicate that high-level processing can be applied even to areas of the visual field that, due to damage, are not consciously perceived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Function of Consciousness\n",
    "1. Milner and Goodale’s research reveals a basic functional distinction in the visual system: vision for perception and vision for action. The ventral visual stream is for perception and high-level action planning and is conscious, while the dorsal visual stream is for online control of action and is unconscious.\n",
    "2. Experiments on the Ebbinghaus illusion and interocular suppression provide support for Milner and Goodale’s dual stream hypothesis.\n",
    "3. Milner and Goodale’s research indicates that consciousness is functionally important for planning and initiating action.\n",
    "4. Priming studies show that consciously perceived primes are retained better and have a greater impact on other cognitive processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hard Problem of Consciousness\n",
    "1. Ned Block’s distinction between access consciousness (or A-consciousness) and phenomenal consciousness (or P-consciousness) can be used to generate a dilemma for the cognitive science of consciousness: cognitive science seems to be informative only for understanding A-consciousness.\n",
    "2. Block claims that there is a double dissociation between A- and P-consciousness. This produces an explanatory gap.\n",
    "3. The conflict between A- and P-consciousness can be understood in terms of what David Chalmers calls the hard problem of consciousness, which Chalmers thinks cannot be solved by cognitive science.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Global Workspace Theory of Consciousness\n",
    "1. The global workspace theory holds that attention makes low-level modular information available for conscious control in the “global workspace,” from where the information is then “broadcast” to other areas of the brain.\n",
    "2. The global workspace theory draws from two basic ideas: (a) consciousness permits information to be explicitly and durably maintained for additional processing and reasoning, and (b) consciousness is necessary for initiating deliberate action.\n",
    "3. Information processing in the global workspace is a type of domain-general process, selecting among competing modular inputs.\n",
    "4. There is some neurological support for the global workspace theory. Pyramidal neurons, for instance, may be responsible for connecting specialized modular processes and broadcasting their outputs throughout the brain for other cognitive processes.\n"
