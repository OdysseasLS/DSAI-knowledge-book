    "- **Tasks** define the problem machine learning is trying to solve. (Predictive vs. Descriptive).\n",
    "  - **A. Predictive Tasks (Supervised Learning)**\n",
    "    - **Classification** → Predicts a categorical label.  \n",
    "      - Example: Image classification, spam detection.\n",
    "    - **Regression** → Predicts a continuous value.  \n",
    "      - Example: Stock price prediction, weather forecasting.\n",
    "    - **Predictive Clustering** → Cluster and predict based on similar features in each cluster. \n",
    "      - Example: Fraud detection, Disease Risk Prediction.\n",
    "        - Cluster 1: \"High-Risk Group\" – Older patients with high BMI and blood pressure.\n",
    "        - Cluster 2: \"Moderate-Risk Group\" – Middle-aged patients with slightly high cholesterol.\n",
    "        - Cluster 3: \"Low-Risk Group\" – Young, healthy individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **B. Descriptive Tasks (Unsupervised Learning)**\n",
    "    - **Descriptive Clustering** → Each cluster has a clear description.\n",
    "      - Example: Customer segmentation, plant species grouping.\n",
    "    - **Association Rule Mining** → Identifies relationships between variables.  \n",
    "      - Example: Market basket analysis (if a person buys bread, they might buy butter).\n",
    "    - **Subgroup Discovery** → Finds interesting patterns within a specific class of data.  \n",
