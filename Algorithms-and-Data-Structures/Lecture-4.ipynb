    "Depth-first search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm where exploration starts from a given vertex. It moves to an adjacent unvisited vertex and continues until it can't proceed further. Then, it backtracks to the last visited vertex and explores the next unvisited adjacent vertex until the process leads back to the starting vertex. It can be implemented recursively or using a stack.\n",
