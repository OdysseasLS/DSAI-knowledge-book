    "### Summary:\n",
    "Depth-first search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm where exploration starts from a given vertex. It moves to an adjacent unvisited vertex and continues until it can't proceed further. Then, it backtracks to the last visited vertex and explores the next unvisited adjacent vertex until the process leads back to the starting vertex. It can be implemented recursively or using a stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Start with a given vertex v.\n",
    "2. Move to an adjacent unvisited vertex.\n",
    "3. Continue this process until no further movement is possible.\n",
    "4. Backtrack to the last visited vertex.\n",
    "5. Explore the next unvisited adjacent vertex.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all vertices reachable from v are visited.\n",
    "7. Keep track of visited vertices to ensure each is visited exactly once.\n",
    "8. If the graph is not connected, repeat the procedure for each disconnected component.\n"

    "Breadth-first search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used for searching a graph layer-wise starting from a given vertex. It explores all the nearest nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This algorithm is implemented using a queue.\n",
