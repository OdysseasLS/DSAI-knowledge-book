    "# What is AI?\n",
    "There is no exact definition as it is a very rich topic with lots of nuances. Just because it is complex and has many different understandings doesn't mean that it can't be discussed.\\\n",
    "AI is not a new concept as it has a long history of being \"The next big thing\", it relates to culture and technological developments.\\\n",
    "Interest in AI is not only out of fear of them turning against humanity, but also comes from fascination either with technology or the idea of intelligence as it can be seen as a form of a mirror for our own existence.\\\n",
    "AI is an exponential tool, meaning a tool that can help in the improving of itself and other tools that relate to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Welcome\n",
    "Information about the course can be found on the Brightspace. The Orientation AI course is the first non computer science course with a focus only on AI.\\\n",
    "Attendance is compulsory (A4 paper will be passed around to check attendance), there is compulsory homework reading, reading material is shown on Brightspace.\\\n",
    "**Professor contact information:**\n",
    "- Dr. Max van Duijn, m.j.van.duijn@liacs.leidenuniv.nl\n",
    "- Dr. Peter van der Putten, p.w.h.van.der.putten@liacs.leidenuniv.nl\n",

    "# Outside perspective in intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apparent Behavior experiment\n",
    "Watch the experiment video in slides, and give opinion.\n",
    "Humans are hardwired into projecting intent into objects and behaviors, an example is the automatons suggested by Ismail al Jazari for automatic music players. Another example is the Sound Activated Mobile by Edward (lastname), which might cause feelings of \"liveliness\" through movement caused by outside stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing expectations\n",
    "Building forms of automatons can have an effect on the expectations, it is better to set lower expectations that are easier to reach rather than impossibly high expectations using current technology. For example, a child-like robot does not create high expectations for complex behavior while adult shaped robots will be expected to achieve more complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Projecting intelligence\n",
    "According to Daniel Dennet, it makes evolutionary sense to project intelligence onto objects whose behavior can be slightly predicted as a rational agent. An example is suddenly meeting a fuzzy creature, it is more logical to treat the creature as an intelligent being with a thinking process, as intelligent beings need food and humans can be food.\n",
    "\n",
    "# History of AI\n",
    "Thomas Hobbes believed that with reasoning a person can understand computation, and computation is to collect sums of many things, thus the sum of many things can lead to reasoning.\\\n",
    "Julien Offroy wanted to answer the question of what is makes us human from a religious point of view but failed to get all answers, then turned to medicine in hopes of making a living and finding answers, then finally turning to philosophy and thinking of humans as complex machines.\\\n",
    "Ada Lovelace was the first programmer, she wrote a program to a theoretical machine to describe a real-life situation using mathematics and theorized that it might be possible to emulate creativity in the future using more complex computations.\\\n",
    "The main building blocks of an intelligent systems are:\n",
    "- Sense\n",
    "- Rules\n",
    "- Memory\n",
    "- Reasoning\n",
    "- Action\n",
    "- Learning\n",
    "- Creativity\n",
    "These blocks can be mapped to each other, it is published on Brightspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Is the brain a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Turing test\n",
    "It is based on the imitation game, but the goal is to figure out if the other party is a human or a machine instead of a man or a woman (the original purpose).\\\n",
    "More information in the slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Russell and Norvig's approach to AI table\n",
    "|          | Human             | Optimal           |\n",
    "|----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n",

    "## AI dichotomies\n",
    "- Strong AI:\n",
    "- Weak AI:\n",
    "- General AI: Can carry out any task intelligently.\n",
    "- Narrow AI: Can perform specific tasks intelligently.\n",
    "- Connectionist AI: Skipped.\n",
    "- Symbolic AI: Skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chinese Room Argument\n",
    "Made to attack strong AI. There is a room with one input window and one output window, person who doesn't speak the input language purely follows the rules to output answers to questions without understanding or thinking what is happening.\n",
    "Thus we are simulating intelligence and not actually creating intelligence, a similar example is simulating fire but not burning anything.\\\n",
    "Arguments and Counter arguments to the Chinese room.\\\n",
    "More information in the reading material.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assessment\n",
    "To help with passing the exam without undue stress, the lecturers will offer possible exam questions during lectures.\n",
    "It is also recommended to be invested in intellectual development during study times, be it during homework or book reading or even during passing time.\\\n",
    "There will be a midterm partial exam and homework. Timeline published later.\n"
