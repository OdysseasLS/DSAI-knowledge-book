# Notes for OAI Final


### Daniel Dennett:  

- Turing Test (Asymmetrical, one-way quick-probe assumption): The computer is intelligent and can simulate thinking  
- Act prediction of rational agent -> treat rational agent -> find out beliefs -> then desires -> predict acts to reach goals  
- The Chinese Room is a flawed thought experiment (intuition pumps: provoke (“pump”) an intuition in the listener)  
- Intentionality is in the observer's eye  
- He believes understanding isn't confined to biological brains and that properly designed artificial systems can genuinely understand 

Machine failure on the Turing test depends on the approach taken by the interrogator but also implies nothing 

#### Russell & Norving 

| | like a human | rational (optimal) |
|---|---|---|
| thinking | General Problem Solver | Aristotle - Law of Thought approach |
| acting | Turing | Intelligent behavior (Reasoning then act) - Specification Gaming |

#### Searle’s theories (Materialist-Theoristian of Chinese Room Argument):   
- He mainly wants to say computers don't understand in the same way as humans but try to imitate it 
- The machine does not "understand" Chinese; therefore, Strong AI is not possible  
- The machine can think because a human is a biological machine  
- Create consciousness: duplicate, not simulate, the physical (brain) processes  
- A consequence of Strong AI: The mind can manipulate a symbol, and the machine only executes  
- Consciousness is a physical property 
- Information processes, such as symbol manipulation, are not physical and cannot cause consciousness  
- Human minds have mental contents (semantics)  
- The program has syntax but no semantics (syntactic)  
- Turing Test: He suggests that passing the test does not necessarily mean the machine understands or thinks; it only means it can imitate human behavior. 

*Daniel Dennett doesn't agree with the Chinese Room, and Searle doesn't agree with the Turing Test showing machines can understand and think 

#### Julien Offray: 
Humans are complex animals with souls -> mind is part of the body   

dualism (separation of body & mind) | | materialism (Inseparable) |
|---|---|---|
| supernatural | natural | |
| Descartes, religious | Crick, brains in a vat, Churchland? Neuroscience establishment? | Noë, 4e-cognition advocates, Dennett? |

#### 4e-cognition (The mind as a dynamic system that includes brain, body, and environment): 

- Embodied: Cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world. 
- Embedded: Cognition depends on the environmental context. 
- Enactive: Cognition arises through active engagement with the environment. 
- Extended: Cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain to include the body and environment. 
- In other words, these are truly thinking and having consciousness requirements. 

#### Epistemology: 
Theory of knowledge regarding its method to justify belief and opinion  

Skepticism (Doubt about everything) -> related to idealism: Due to Idealism, we use skepticism 

Idealism (Understanding reality is mentally or based on consciousness) -> Plato cave - Archimedean - Brain in vat 

René Descartes -> Rationalism (reasoning for the test of knowledge) != Empiricism (learning by experience and observation) 

In Matrix: Neo discovers that his entire reality is a simulated world created by machines, like Descartes' evil demon hypothesis, which suggests that a powerful, deceptive being could manipulate our perceptions 

6 Meditations: 

Skepticism - idealism (the world is ultimately mental): we cannot know whether it does and what it's like via our senses 

The existence of the mind is distinguished from the body 

Reason for the existence of God  

Perceptions are true and discuss the nature of error 

God's Existence 

distinguish between understanding and imagination 

#### Rodney Brooks (Materialist) 

Principle: Incremental Intelligence:  

- bottom-up (Simple process and avoiding explicit symbolic representation)  
- decentralized  
- decomposition by activity, not function  
- no model >> flexible, robust  

##### AI cannot rely on humans for their representation in: 

- charging and incomplete environment 
- repair and develop themselves 
- human rules 

#### Alva Noe: 

Understanding consciousness needs considering the dynamic interaction of Body-Brain-Environment  

consciousness is more like dancing than digestion because it's more of an action than something that happens, and it is something from the outside as from the inside  

Mental processes -> embodied and enactive and extend beyond the head of the intelligent person  

The idea of "Astonishing hypothesis" -> You are not your brain  

consciousness is the 'dance' of the neural system in interaction with the body and environment  

concept of "Enaction" -> Consciousness arises through active engagement with the environment  

-> The brain generates consciousness like the computer generates software.  

Merkwelt: emphasizes the active role of consciousness in shaping perception and meaning  

Intentionality (the capacity of a system to be about something) != being capable of intention  

An intentional being has states including beliefs, desires, intentions  

Recall Rorty: there is no Archimedean point from which we can double-check if a phenomenon is what we think  

#### The three ways of creativity (Margaret Boden)  

- Combinatorial creativity - Making unfamiliar combinations  
- Explorative creativity - Exploring conceptual spaces: new ideas within existing conceptual space  
- Transformative creativity – Change the conceptual space  
- A key issue in computational creativity is not the creation of transformative ideas or artifacts – but the inability to value these  

PAPER (Artificial Intelligence problems) {  

Automatic Computers: Limited by current technology and programming capabilities.  

Language Use: Language manipulation and reasoning are not fully developed.  

Neuron Nets: Ongoing research into creating concept-forming neuron structures.  

Calculation Size Theory: Efficiency in problem-solving linked to understanding calculation complexity.  

Self-Improvement: Intelligent machines capable of self-improvement; need more study.  

Abstractions: Importance of machine methods for forming abstractions.  

Randomness in Creativity: Creative thinking may involve guided randomness.  

}  

#### Theory of Mind (ToM: mindreading): 
Understanding others' thoughts and feelings to predict their behavior.  

#### Abstract robots: 
Theoretical models or representations of robots. These models are not physical entities but conceptual ones, used for various purposes such as Simulating and Testing Algorithms, focusing on the essence of robotic behavior, control, and learning 

#### Superintelligence should have a kill switch -> their goals should align with human goals -> Keeping AI in controlled environments is essential for safety.
