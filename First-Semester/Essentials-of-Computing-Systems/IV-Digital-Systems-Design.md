# Digital Systems Design

**Metastability:** State of instability or uncertainty that occurs in digital circuits.

Flip-Flops (FF):
- DFF: Data/Clock
- SR FF: Set/Reset Clock

Latches: 
- D Latch: Data/Enable
- SR Latch: Set/Reset Enable

Unlike flip-flops, latches can change their output while the enable signal is active.
