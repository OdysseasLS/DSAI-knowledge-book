    "#### **Search Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n",
    "   - Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next depth.\n",
    "   - **Completeness**: Guaranteed if branching factor (b) is finite.\n",
    "   - **Optimality**: Yes, if all actions have the same cost.\n",
    "   - **Time/Space Complexity**: $ O(b^d) $, where $ d $ is the depth of the shallowest goal node.\n",
    "   - Uses a FIFO queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**:\n",
    "   - Expands the node with the lowest path cost ($ g(n) $).\n",
    "   - **Completeness**: Guaranteed if step costs are non-negative.\n",
    "   - **Optimality**: Always finds the least-cost solution.\n",
    "   - **Time/Space Complexity**: $ O(b^{1 + \\lfloor C^* / \\epsilon \\rfloor}) $, where $ C^* $ is the solution cost and $ \\epsilon $ is the smallest step cost.\n",
    "   - Uses a priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:\n",
    "   - Explores the deepest unexpanded node first.\n",
    "   - **Completeness**: No (fails on infinite paths without a depth limit).\n",
    "   - **Optimality**: No.\n",
    "   - **Time Complexity**: $ O(b^m) $, where $ m $ is the maximum depth.\n",
    "   - **Space Complexity**: $ O(bm) $, very memory-efficient.\n",
    "   - Uses a LIFO stack or recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**:\n",
    "   - DFS with a fixed depth limit.\n",
    "   - **Completeness**: No if the limit is too shallow.\n",
    "   - **Optimality**: No if the limit exceeds the optimal solution depth.\n",
    "   - **Time/Space Complexity**: $ O(b^l) $, where $ l $ is the depth limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**:\n",
    "   - Repeatedly runs DLS with increasing depth limits.\n",
    "   - Combines BFS's completeness and DFS's low memory use.\n",

    "   - **Optimality**: Yes, if step costs are uniform.\n",
    "   - **Time/Space Complexity**: $ O(b^d) $.\n",

    "2. **Heuristics for the 8-Puzzle**:\n",
    "   - $ h_1 $: Number of misplaced tiles (admissible).\n",
    "   - $ h_2 $: Manhattan distance (sum of horizontal and vertical distances, admissible and more effective).\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Relaxed Problems**:\n",
    "   - Simplifying constraints in the original problem to compute heuristics.\n",
    "   - Relaxed problems must be easy to solve for the heuristic to be computationally feasible.\n",
