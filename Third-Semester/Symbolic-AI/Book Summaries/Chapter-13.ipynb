    "### Quantifying Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Uncertainty and Rational Decisions**\n",
    "1. **Sources of Uncertainty**:\n",
    "   - Partial observability, nondeterminism, or incomplete knowledge.\n",
    "   - Logical reasoning struggles with uncertainty due to **laziness**, **theoretical ignorance**, and **practical ignorance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Degrees of Belief**:\n",
    "   - Use **probability theory** for quantifying uncertainty.\n",
    "   - Beliefs are between 0 (false) and 1 (true).\n",
    "   - Example: A toothache increases the probability of a cavity but doesn’t guarantee it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rational Decisions**:\n",
    "   - Combine **utility theory** (preferences over outcomes) with probabilities.\n",
    "   - **Decision theory = Probability + Utility**.\n",
    "   - The principle of **Maximum Expected Utility (MEU)**:\n",
    "     - Choose the action with the highest expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Probability Basics**\n",
    "1. **Definitions**:\n",
    "   - **Sample Space (Ω)**: Set of all possible worlds (e.g., outcomes of a dice roll).\n",
    "   - **Events**: Subsets of possible worlds defined by propositions.\n",
    "   - **Unconditional (prior) probability**: P(A).\n",
    "   - **Conditional (posterior) probability**: P(A | B), updated with evidence B.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Equations**:\n",
    "   - **Sum Rule**: $ P(a \\lor b) = P(a) + P(b) - P(a \\land b) $.\n",
    "   - **Product Rule**: $ P(a \\land b) = P(a | b)P(b) $.\n",
    "   - **Conditional Probability**: $ P(a | b) = \\frac{P(a \\land b)}{P(b)} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Joint Probability Distribution**:\n",
    "   - Describes probabilities for all combinations of random variables.\n",
    "   - Example: $ P(Weather, Cavity) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Inference Using Full Joint Distributions**\n",
    "1. **Marginalization**:\n",
    "   - Compute probabilities for a subset of variables by summing over others.\n",
    "   - $ P(Y) = \\sum_{Z} P(Y, Z) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normalization**:\n",
    "   - Convert raw probabilities into valid distributions (sums to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limitations**:\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: Full joint tables grow exponentially with the number of variables ($ 2^n $ for $ n $ Boolean variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Independence**\n",
    "1. **Definition**:\n",
    "   - Variables $ X $ and $ Y $ are independent if:\n",
    "     - $ P(X | Y) = P(X) $ or $ P(X \\land Y) = P(X)P(Y) $.\n",
    "   - Example: Weather is independent of dental issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Benefits**:\n",
    "   - Simplifies joint distributions (e.g., splitting variables into smaller groups).\n",
    "   - Reduces storage and computation complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example**:\n",
    "   - For $ n $ independent coin flips, $ P(C_1, ..., C_n) = \\prod P(C_i) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications of Bayes' Rule**\n",
    "1. **Bayes' Rule**:\n",
    "   - $ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A)P(A)}{P(B)} $, where $ P(B) \\neq 0 $.\n",
    "   - Allows updating beliefs based on new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diagnostic Example**:\n",
    "   - Prior: $ P(cavity) = 0.2 $.\n",
    "   - Evidence: $ P(cavity | toothache) = 0.6 $.\n",
    "   - Update probabilities with observed evidence for better decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Considerations**\n",
    "1. **Frequentist vs. Bayesian Views**:\n",
    "   - **Frequentist**: Probabilities from experimental data (e.g., frequency of outcomes).\n",
    "   - **Bayesian**: Probabilities represent subjective belief, updated with evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Utility of Probabilities**:\n",
    "   - Probabilities quantify uncertainty in a mathematically consistent way.\n",
    "   - Decision-making frameworks (e.g., risk assessments, AI systems)."
