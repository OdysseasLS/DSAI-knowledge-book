    "#### **Four Approaches to AI**\n",
    "1. **Acting Humanly:**\n",
    "   - Turing Test capabilities:\n",
    "     - Natural language processing.\n",
    "     - Knowledge representation.\n",
    "     - Automated reasoning.\n",
    "     - Machine learning.\n",
    "2. **Thinking Humanly:**\n",
    "   - Cognitive modeling through introspection, experiments, and imaging.\n",
    "   - Example: GPS (General Problem Solver) mimicked human thought patterns.\n",
    "3. **Thinking Rationally:**\n",
    "   - Formal logic, syllogisms (e.g., Aristotle).\n",
    "   - Limitations: Translating real-world problems to formal logic can be hard.\n",
    "4. **Acting Rationally:**\n",
    "   - Rational agents take actions to maximize expected outcomes.\n",
    "   - Broader than just inference and includes reflex actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Notes:**\n",
    "- AI will never reach higher IQ level than humans due lack of consciousness, creativity, and emotions.\n",
    "- Reflex actions (Flinching from a hot stove) are **not rational** as they bypass conscious deliberation. They are also **not intelligent** as got pre-programmed biological responses.\n",
    "- We study the problem of building agents with **Rational Action** that are intelligent in this sense.\n",
    "- Psychologists adopted the idea that humans and animals can be considered information-processing machines."
