    "   - Arbitrary changes (mutations) are made to the program.\n",
    "   - Changes produce a **mutant** program.\n",
    "     - If the test suite detects the mutation, the mutant is considered **dead**.\n",
    "     - If undetected, the test suite needs improvement.\n",
    "   - **Types**:\n",
    "     1. **Value Mutations**: Change numerical values.\n",

    "### **Pytest: Basics**\n",
    "- **Installation**:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install -U pytest\n",
    "  pytest --version\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Create a Test**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # test_sample.py\n",
    "  def func(x):\n",
    "      return x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  def test_answer():\n",
    "      assert func(3) == 5\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Run with `pytest` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - **Fixtures**: Set up dependencies for tests.\n",
    "  - **Parameterized Tests**: Test multiple inputs and outputs.\n",
    "  - **Exception Handling**: Verify that specific exceptions are raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pytest Features**\n",
    "1. **Fixtures**:\n",
    "   - Reusable setups for tests.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @pytest.fixture\n",
    "   def sample_fixture():\n",
    "       return 42\n",
    "\n",
    "   def test_with_fixture(sample_fixture):\n",
    "       assert sample_fixture == 42\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Parameterized Tests**:\n",
    "   - Run the same test with multiple inputs.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @pytest.mark.parametrize(\"a, b, expected\", [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 5)])\n",
    "   def test_addition(a, b, expected):\n",
    "       assert a + b == expected\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - Test that a function raises an exception.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n",
    "       int(\"invalid\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **Temporary Directories**:\n",
    "   - Use `tmp_path` to create unique temporary directories during tests.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def test_temp_dir(tmp_path):\n",
    "       file = tmp_path / \"example.txt\"\n",
    "       file.write_text(\"content\")\n",
    "       assert file.read_text() == \"content\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Good Practices in Testing**\n",
    "1. **Group Tests in Classes**:\n",
    "   - Organize related tests.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class TestMath:\n",
    "       def test_add(self):\n",
    "           assert 1 + 1 == 2\n",
    "\n",
    "       def test_subtract(self):\n",
    "           assert 2 - 1 == 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Assertion Introspection**:\n",
    "   - Pytest provides detailed error reporting for failed assertions.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def test_fail():\n",
    "       assert 4 == 5  # Output: AssertionError: assert 4 == 5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Mark Test Attributes**:\n",
    "   - Use `pytest.mark` to categorize tests.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @pytest.mark.slow\n",
    "   def test_long_running():\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced Pytest Concepts**\n",
    "1. **Plugins**:\n",
    "   - Extend pytest functionality with plugins (e.g., pytest-django, pytest-cov).\n",
    "2. **Custom Fixtures**:\n",
    "   - Create reusable fixtures for project-specific setups.\n",
    "3. **Test Discovery**:\n",
    "   - Pytest automatically detects test files named `test_*.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise**:\n",
    "Write tests for the following **calculator.py** functions:\n",
    "1. Addition\n",
    "2. Subtraction\n",
    "3. Multiplication\n",
    "4. Division  \n",
    "Use **fixtures** for reusable setups and **parameterized tests** for input/output validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Testing ≠ Verification**\n",
    "- **Quote**: \"Program testing can show the presence of bugs, but never their absence.\"  \n",
    "  – *Edsger W. Dijkstra*  \n",
    "- Testing identifies issues but cannot guarantee a program is completely error-free."
