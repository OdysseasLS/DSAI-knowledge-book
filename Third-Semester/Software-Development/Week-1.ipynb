    "- **Control Flow Oriented Style**: It is based on if-then-else and do-while constructs.\n",

    "- **Data Structure Oriented Style**: Design programâ€™s data structures, and then develop the code structure based on the data structure.\n",
    "- **Data Flow Oriented Style**: It is based on the concept of data flow diagrams (DFDs).\n",
    "- **Object Oriented Style**: It is based on the concept of objects. An object is a real-world entity that has a state and behavior."
