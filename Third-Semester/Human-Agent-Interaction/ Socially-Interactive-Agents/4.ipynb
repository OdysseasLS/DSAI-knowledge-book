    "     - **Consistency vs. Inconsistency**: Metaphors can be consistent (appearance and behavior align, like a dog behaving like a dog) or inconsistent (a dog that speaks).\n",

    "   - **Facial Features**: The face is crucial for user interaction, conveying emotion, attention, and trustworthiness.\n",
    "     - Subtle facial adjustments (e.g., eye size) affect perceptions of trust or aggression.\n",
    "   - **Body Features**: The agentâ€™s body, including clothing and accessories, contributes to its perceived role and functionality."
