    "   - **Coding Schemes**: Systems like FACS (Facial Action Coding System) help standardize the description of facial expressions by breaking them into muscular movements (AUs or Action Units).\n",

    "### **Models and Approaches**\n",
    "   - **Rule-based Models**: Early models like GestureJack and REA (Real-Estate Agent) used rules derived from social science to drive the generation of nonverbal behaviors.\n",
    "   - **Performance-based Models**: Use human recordings (e.g., motion capture) to generate animations, preserving the natural timing of speech and gestures.\n",
    "   - **Machine Learning Models**: These models use data to learn the relationship between speech and gestures. Techniques include HMMs (Hidden Markov Models), Dynamic Bayesian Networks, and deep learning models like LSTMs and GANs.\n",
