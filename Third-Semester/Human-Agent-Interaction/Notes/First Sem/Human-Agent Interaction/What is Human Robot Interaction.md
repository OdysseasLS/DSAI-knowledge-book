HRI needs [[4E cognition - Robot Interact|embodied cognition]] and [[4E cognition - Robot Interact|embedded cognition]]

[[Embodied robots]] are constrained by the way they interact with the world in the same way people are

Interaction needs to be more than **do this do that**  - considering this then ChatGPT may not necessarily be an agent 

If we consider robots like ChatGPT![[#Is ChatGPT Alive]] for instance they have no <font color=DC143C>limits</font> in terms of possible ways they can interact with the world, if they create their own mini-world(shrdlu)

A chat bot can be socially interactive however not in the way you use it

Approach to HRI 
- <font color=FFD700>How a robot works</font> - [[How a Robot Works|link]]
- <font color=48D1CC>How does it interact</font> - [[Robot Interaction |link]]
- <font color=ADFF2F>What is the general public’s opinion</font>
- <font color=FF69B4>Ethical issues and bias in studies</font>

Knowledge Representation
Scientists + Engineers - Explicit through published papers
Designers - Implicit<font color=FA8072>(knowledge repr through art)</font>

World
Engineers + Designers - Transform world<font color=FA8072>(what do we want and how do we get there)</font>
Scientist is - Understand World

Focus 
Engineers - WE WANT TECH - technology aspect
Scientist + Designer - Human values to robot<font color=FA8072>(for design)</font> and understanding people<font color=FA8072>(how we represent them through cog sci)</font> - human aspect

#### Is ChatGPT Alive


| Yes                                          | No                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wants to avoid sensitive or important topics | Does it have wants                                                              |
| The idea that it wants to continue living    | Does our perception of life matter? It’s still simple code                      |
| Does it appear to live?                      | Avoidance of certain topics may just be hard coded. Not a reflection of desires |
|                                              |                                                                                 |

Snap chat AI vs ChatGPT AI 
Since the Chatgpt AI is not proactive whereas the SnapChat one asks proactive questions about your day 

So an agent can be considered social if its more proactive than reactive 

SnapChat - proactive
ChaptGPT -reactive
