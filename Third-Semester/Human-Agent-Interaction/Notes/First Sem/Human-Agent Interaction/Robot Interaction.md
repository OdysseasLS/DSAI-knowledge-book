Interaction assumes that there is a pattern of information exchange


##### Interaction hinges on [[Robot Design|affordance]] 
1. If a robot starts a conversation it should be able to follow through 
2. Otherwise affordance needs to made to ensure the conversation carried by the interaction partner/human -> Is carried in a way that the user only asks certain questions to the bot
3. Interactive agents affords dialogues 
4. If a human perceives a robot to be capable of some interaction it should be able to meet 

Modality is what you use for the dialogue(gesture modality or whatnot)

==modality is a channel of communication==

The dialogue is the pattern of information exchange (what is getting sent and what response are you getting from the robot)
