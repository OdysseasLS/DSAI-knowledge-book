Iterative quality
Social context needs to be considered in the design process

**Frankenstein Approach(inside-out)**
Solve technical issues first and then adjust the design later

Can start from the robot -> add sensors -> add actuators -> adjust design to cover these parts to make it seem more <font color=00FF7F>finished</font>

Interaction capabilities must be decided after 

**Outside-in robot design**
Consider
- Characteristic of users
- Context of use

And then adjust design features <font color=4169E1>(appearance, interaction modalities + level of autonomy) </font>

Interaction modalities - actuators, sensors 

Autonomy - processing

Desired interaction capability decided before and then robot is created for it

##### Inside Out
Start with limits of tech, then develop a solution that works now
Adjust design with customer feedback far later

##### Outside In

Start with user needs, but takes time to make the ideal sol
Customer feedback is used to design sol

#### Robot morphology 
Form and function impact design 

Limited capabilities -> impact design(so no false expectations)

Robjects - robots whose design is based on objects 

#### Affordance
Affordance - perceivable relationship between an organism and it’s environment that enable it to carry out actions

Must be made explicit for design

Choice for the [[Embodied robots|Paro]] to be a seal instead of let’s say a dog(because with a dog the affordance would need to be made for the dog to perform tricks - with Paro if it cuddles it’s good enough)

Signal appropriate way for humans to interact with people

#### Design patterns
Design patterns - problem that occurs in env and a solution that can be used to fix that problem without ever doing it the same way

You can think of it as travelling sales man problem with multiple solutions or permutations without replacement

Problem rearrange stuff 
Solution will not repeat a chosen answer ie (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1)

Patterns for HRI 
- Didactic communication pattern - Robot becomes a teacher
- Motion pattern - robot initiates movement and then aligns to what the human does
- Personal Interests and history 
- Recover form mistakes/social mishaps 
- Reciprocal turn-taking in game context - makes sure that each agent takes their turn speaking and then finishes before robot interacts 
- Physical intimacy - [[Spatial interaction Robot|the way the robot interacts with a human’s personal space]]
- Claiming unfair treatment - demonstrating when a person has been rude to the robot 

Design Pattern:
1. Intent 
2. Motivation 
3. Structure 
4. Example

<font color=00BFFF>Design patterns</font> - pattern for robots what has been done in the past 
### Design principles 

1. Match form and function - Social norms and cultural stereotypes can comes into play. Anthropomorphising the design is only useful if the robot is expected to behave like a human
2. Underpromise & overdeliver - People’s expectation can be raised by robot appearance, if the expectation are lower then the robots functions are more impressive
3. Interaction expands function - Open ended designs allow people to interpret it in different ways and use it in different ways

4. Holistic design— capability, behaviour and affordance should work together- [[Anthropomorphization in Robot design|Uncanny Valley]]

### Design Process 
- Define problem 
- Build interaction 
- Test 
- Analyze
- Repeat from step 2 until satisfied 

*Engineering design process*
Problem definition -> numerous solutions are considered

Simulation is used to adjust the design while considering the technical capacity needed first

Validating a solution in a simulation is not always accurate to real world testing

<font color=DC143C>Limits</font>
1. Simulation testing may not be practical 
2. Interaction design problems - there are known unknowns that may not be accounted for 
3. Relaxing requirement tests means that the solution will only just be good enough 
4. Instead of focusing on what matters, may just focus on what can be measurably successful 

*User centred design*
Focus on who will use it and adjust design accordingly 

> Design processes in which end users influence how a design takes shape

Stakeholders are identified
- field studies 
- User testing
- Interviews 
- Surveys

Prototypes 
1. Low fidelity(static mock-ups) - simplistic and may use rp 
2. High fidelity(animatronics) 

Stakeholders 
1. Primary users -> people who will directly interact with robot 
2. Secondary -> occasionally come in contact with robot
3. Tertiary -> lives that indirectly affected by the robot

*Participatory design*
Design is full formed or partially formed 

User input is sued to tests the assumptions the design is making and other external factors impacting it

But participatory design can lead to overfitting(where the design is suited to one user’s needs not the majority)

<font color=DC143C>Limits</font>
1. Stakeholders may have unrealistic ideas
2. Designers have first hand knowledge 
3. Fostering mutual learning 



#### Cultural Consideration 
Connections between cultures of a certain location and the use of robots 

HRI can bridge the gap between cultural differences and if a robot isn’t humanoid then a cultural faux pas is less frowned upon
