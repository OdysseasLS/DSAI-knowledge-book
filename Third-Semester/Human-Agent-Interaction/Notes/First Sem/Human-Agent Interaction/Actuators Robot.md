Convert electric signals to be able to physically manipulate the environment
Can be rotational or linear 

**Motor**
DC Motor 
Current in coils to induce electromagnetic fields that cause rotation

DC servo motor - Like a regular DC motor but consists of:
- DC motor 
- Microcontroller
- Sensor 

Control speed PWM(pulse-width modulation)
Done through feedback control cycle

Position control + speed

<font color=7B68EE>DOF</font>- degree of freedom related to number of sensors the robot has 


<font color=7B68EE>DOF</font> - they are dimensions of movement + can be related to number of actusators + 
Motor design must relate to the actions we want the robot to take

Movement dimension or any dimension 

Moving fingers individually adds to a degree of freedom 


**Pneumatic actuators**
Uses piston and compressed air 

Similar to muscle movement because itâ€™s linear(unlike electric motors)

Can be loud so need to ensure that does not impact human-robot interactivity

| High speed that is difficulty to achieve by other means                                        | Air compressors are rather loud                                                                    |
| Prefers humanoid robots can achieve human movements - [[Anthropomorphization in Robot design]] | Compressed air tanks have a lower energy density than batteries might not be able to work for long |

**Wheels**
Provide a convenient means of transport for robots, easier than legs 

Omnidirectional Wheels 
Omnidirectional wheels allow a robot to travel without the need to turn 

Tracks 
Tracks allow a robot to traverse more difficult terrain

**Legs**

Legs over wheels 
- Flexibility for terrain 
- Energy efficient 
- Can make it more stable 

Legs for HRI 
- for [[Anthropomorphization in Robot design|anthropomorphic]] character
- Navigate human env
- More human expression + can communicate human 

Anthropomorphic 

**Speaker**

Important for human interaction or at least in regard to the level of human interaction 

Pitch of a voice can influence the interaction be determining who leads the convo(who is more dominant human/AI)
