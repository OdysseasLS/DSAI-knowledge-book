Attribution of human-like traits to inanimate objects

It influences the functionality of the robot(the more human-like the more it needs to do)

Non-humanoid robots can have anthropomorphic features - because humans have a tendency to see our features in something else

### Theorising 
Psychological perspective 
1. Effective motivation - explain and understand the interaction of others including robots
2. Sociality motivation - To address feelings of loneliness we pretend non-human entities have the ability to interact with us
3. Elicited agent knowledge - We use our understanding of social interactions and apply them to robots even if there they don’t work the way our subconscious presumes they do

**[[Robot Design|Designing]] for Anthropomorphism** 
	Visual appearance
	Actions taken 
	Social cues demonstrated 

It impacts - 
	Tech development if you choose to do it 
	Design appearance 
	Design of motion(can not make head rotate 360^o)
	Evaluation of interaction 

Types:
1. Android Robots - Data from StarTrek - designed as humanlike as possible
2. Near Android Robots - take over the world Sofia - deliberately part human part robot 
3. Humanoid - Abstract human form - [[Nano Robot|Nao]]
4. Non-humanoid -> provides some level of anthropomorphic features, so that humans understand how to interact with it 
5. Zoomorphic - Animal like appearance - Paro(SO DAMN CUTE)

The type of robot will impact the behaviour the human expects it to have

How to create human like behaviour:
Through animation even of shapes 
Purely by movement - dot and a line
Non-humanoid - like roomba allowing Tooty to be passenger princess 
Humanlike descriptions of observed behaviour do help the robot 

> We are almost too eager to give non-living things human-like qualities. In part it’s the human desire to form bonds and connect which makes us see this trait in entities that display anything close to it 



#### Uncanny Valley - 
The more humanoid a robot is the more likeable it will be until it reaches a point where it is too human

However it could also just be that a humanoid robot does not match the user’s expectations

So the uncanny valley is not necessarily that the agents are too human, its that they are too perfect 

Slow change to get rid of Uncanny valley -> to make it more realistic by getting rid of perfection in faces -> adding asymmetry, adding facial defects and adding noise


### <font color=00FF7F>Psych aspect </font>

Effective motivation - Explain the robot behaviour as that of a social actor + may help children with autism learn how to interact with people 

Socialites motivation - Non human entities as social interaction partners can help avoid loneliness 

Elicited Agent Knowledge - Can recognise features of a stereotypical social interaction and can provide those norms to a partner<span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"></span>
