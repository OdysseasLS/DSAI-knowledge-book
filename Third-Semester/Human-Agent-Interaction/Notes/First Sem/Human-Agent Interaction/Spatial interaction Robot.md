Robotic placement need to consider people’s preferences and social norms that govern placement in relation to others

### Social distance 
**Proxemics**
Four distance zones 
1. Intimate distance - 0m - 0.5m
2. Personal distance - 0.5m - 1.2m
3. Less personal distance/Social distance - 1.2m - 4m 
4. Public distance - 4m - 4m+

Low-contact cultures 
High-contact cultures(French kiss on cheeks)

**Group interaction dynamics** 
O-space - “one to which they have equal direct and exclusive access” 

Participants are in the p-space

R -space is what is outside

A robot needs to pay attention to these interaction between people and not enter this o-space if the people are conversing

A - face to face 
B - L shape 
C - Side by Side
D - Circular 

What would you choose if you’re talking to a friend but still open to someone to talk 
It’s B
### Spatial Interaction 
Robots will be rejected if they ignore personal space norms

Of course depends on the situation and context

The shortest path to goal must be planned while taking into account social distance 


Localizations  - The robot needs to know where it is
Simultaneous localization and mapping - SLAM

SLAM - Robot builds it’s own map of the surroundings and figure out where it is on the built map using odometry(from laser range finders or camera)

User interaction
Understanding the way humans describe spaces(verbally) to build maps

**Socially appropriate positioning**
Our positioning depends on [[Nonverbal interaction Robot |non verbal cues]]
So this needs to be understood by the robot

HRI can be used to determine the distance humans and comfortable with near robots

It may not be accurate to what a robot computes to be safe - but probability models can help in this

Spatial dynamics of initiating HRI 
Successful social encounter - by initiating social encounters

The way and approach of initiating  a social encounter is dependent on the task 

Prefer robots to behave with “legibility” that allow users to understand the goal & intention

Socially acceptable and comfortable HRI - 1. Human proxemics, 2. conversational relation, 3. relational positioning & 4. approach behaviours


When a person is walking on one direction the robot perceives a cone of probability of where the human may continue walking. So the robot needs to not only not hit the human but also not the cone. 

#### Posture and Activity
Needs to communicate the same things as a human in terms of interaction(affordance must be implemented)
