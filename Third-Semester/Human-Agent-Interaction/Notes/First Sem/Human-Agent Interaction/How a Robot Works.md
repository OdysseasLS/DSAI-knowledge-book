Sensors can help regarding any information that is to deal with the surrounding world. 
However intelligence and knowing what to do in their surroundings needs to be explicitly defined 

AI goal - convert the meaningless Datta from sensors into meaningful data that can be used for interactions

Questions that need to be answered during dev
1. Morphology(/body) of robot 
2. Location awareness and ability to move in a space 
3. Control of body parts
4. Robot’s goals
5. Awareness of obstacles and people for potential social interactions([[4E cognition - Robot Interact| Embodied Cognition]])
6. Can it understand human cues and react accordingly to human’s expression


**Hardware**
Commercial robots are suitable for [[What is Human Robot Interaction| HRI research ]] 

Multiple different morphologies like Aibo, Pepper, K5 and Telepresence robots 

These robots are limited by it’s commercial function and the features the morphology allows the robot to engage in

Expectation is based on morphology - expect more intellect from humanoid robots than robots shaped like a pet

Tend to assign traits to inanimate objects based on what we can see - [[Embodied robots|Kismet Robot]]
