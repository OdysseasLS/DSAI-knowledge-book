What is a robot Agent - Percieves its environment through [[How a Robot Works|sensors]] and acts [[Robot Interaction| autonomously or interacts]] in the env 

Senses and acts autonomously through implicit or explicitly defined goals 

 
### Lvl of [[4E cognition - Robot Interact|embodiment]]

 <font color=FF7F50>Physical embodiment</font>
Social robots - Like [[Embodied robots]] through using actuators and morphology 

<font color=C71585>Minimal Embodiment </font>
Chat bots - (text box could technically be a body), ==modality is a channel of communication==, (an NPC can impact the world )

<font color=40E0D0>Virtual Embodiment </font>
Intelligent Virtual Agents(use [[Nonverbal interaction Robot|gestures]]), NPCâ€™s - can interact with a virtual world that has been provided(what you want to do for Software Dev)

### Types of robots
#### Mobile Agents 
A <font color=40E0D0>virtually</font> embodied autonomous software program that can move between different networked environments, executing tasks on behalf of users or systems, making independent decisions, and communicating via <font color=7FFF00>network protocols and data streams</font>.

Or a <font color=FF7F50>physically</font> embodied robot such as a Roomba that can move across rooms and clean the each room in the house. 
#### Telepresence Robots
A <font color=FF7F50>physically</font> embodied robot that allows a remote user to navigate and interact with physical environments. These robots provide the user with sensory feedback (visual, auditory), enabling them to participate in <font color=7FFF00>real-time communication and navigation</font> in distant locations.

#### Industrial Robots 
A <font color=FF7F50>physically</font> embodied robotic system designed to perform repetitive, precise tasks in manufacturing or production. These robots operate autonomously or semi-autonomously using <font color=7FFF00>programmed commands and sensor-based feedback</font> to optimize efficiency and safety in industrial environments.

#### Socially Interactive Agent 
a <font color=40E0D0>virtually</font> or <font color=FF7F50>physically</font> embodied agent that is capable of autonomously
communicating with people and each other in a socially intelligent manner using multi-modal<font color=7FFF00>(many different streams of communication for a behaviour)</font> behaviours
