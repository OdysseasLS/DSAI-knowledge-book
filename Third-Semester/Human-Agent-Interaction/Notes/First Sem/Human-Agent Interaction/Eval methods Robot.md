### Goals:
Robustness (robot centered evaluation)
- Tech issues 

Usability 
- Types of interaction and testing interaction of robot 
- Even in terms of latency(social int is fast spaced so if the robot responds late people can not respond)

Perception 
- How do users see the robot 
- How have design principles change this 

Impact 
- Affective — emotions are changes because of robot 
- Cognitive — does the robot help the user learn 
- Behavioural — eg children with autism can learn social int 

> Whether the short term or long term impact is more important -> Would depend on the research question and the purpose of the robot
#### Methods 
Research Type 
- Exploratory - open question + for example: **How does interacting with robot cause people to react, positively negatively on average**
- Confirmatory - closed question + for example: **Stats to demonstrate cognitive impact for a condition**

Outcome 
- Qualitative - interviews/ observation 
- Quantitative - 
	- Subjective - a survey(or a questionnaire /google form)
	- Objective - ehhh

## <font color=00FA9A>Study Type</font>
1. Case Study - very specific example, you don’t need a total sample
2. Classical exp - Using independent variables you get to test certain aspects of the robot 
3. Observational - testing robot in a more specific use case <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"><font color=00FA9A>scenario</font></mark> 

Mode of interaction 
- Autonomous robot int - real robot including intended functionality 
- Simulated study - using a virtual robot or videos of the robot interaction(but you can’t really interact with the robot)
- Wizard of Oz - Robot is partly control by a human during HRI
	- Guidelines for the human - Can view the world through the robots eyes
	- It will use a decision tree(likened to a program) for decision making 
	- Example: **A robot needs to make a decision on whether a child is happy or sad. The robot can outsource this to a human. The human decides at this point what it is and then the robot sets a certain type of interaction**



Location context 
1. Lab study - Performed in a lab setting(sterile in env with few variables)
2. Field study - When the interaction is in the real world - intended use case(may not necessarily work in the env when it works) —> *OAI - you should not test it in the lab case because you might have to redevelop the robot to make it work in irl*
3. Crowd source study - Amazon MTurk —> may not be intended use case but simulation, but can get many test users 

##### <font color=FF1493>Temporal Context </font>
- Single inter - consists of one session, impact study does not tend to work for single interaction(because you want to change human behaviour and we do NOT like change)
- Repeated inter - where the int consists of several repeated sessions potential with some time in between 
- Long-term inter - where the in can continue for a longer period of time and sometimes is at the initiative of the user

### User Involvement 
Before the design - [[Robot Design|User centered Design]]
- User provide requirements 

During the Design - [[Robot Design|Participatory Design]]


After Designed 

##### Analysis 
Participants
Demographic of the participants - age, gender, ed lvl

Level of familiarity with robots 
- novelty and robophobia 

Generalisation and participant selection 

Stats
In a casual relation =ship you use classical testing -> you get to measure the specific variables.

Casual correlation vs ______ __ correlation 

The number of people who drown vs the number of people who’ve had ice cream 

Qualittative 
Quotes from users 
Counting the quotes from users and stuff
