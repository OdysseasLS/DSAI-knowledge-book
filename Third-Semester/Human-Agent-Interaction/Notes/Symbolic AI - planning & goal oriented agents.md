Planning is a corner stone of intelligent agents 

Per-condition -> can only carry out a predicate if certain conditions are met

Post-condition -> a confirmation if the predicate has been carried out correctly 


Forward progression 
Can use A*, BFS, or DFS

Keep firing actions until we are happy


Backwards regresssion 

WE start from the end of the state 

Supply inverse post conditions 


Hungry - Eating -> not hungry 

But for example if we were not hungry and the ate we again reach not hungry but it couldâ€™ve been true
