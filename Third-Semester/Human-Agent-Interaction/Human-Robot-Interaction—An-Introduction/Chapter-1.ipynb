    "### **Definition and Scope of HRI**:\n",
    "   - **HRI** focuses on how humans and robots interact, especially with **social robots**, which differ from traditional robots designed for physical tasks.\n",
    "   - Key characteristics of social robots include:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Embodiment:** They often have humanlike features (e.g., eyes, a face).\n",
    "         - **Embodiment** of a robot (e.g., having eyes, a mouth) influences human interaction and expectations.\n",
    "      - **Social skills:** Eye contact, following conversation norms, or recognizing emotions.\n",
    "      - **Influence on human perception:** Their design and appearance (e.g., eyes imply the robot can see).\n",
    "         - Humanlike features trigger people to treat robots as social beings, but this can lead to frustration if robots donâ€™t meet expectations.\n"

    "### **HRI vs HCI**:\n",
    "   - **HRI** is unique because it deals with **embodied interactions** with robots in the social world, whereas **HCI** (Human-Computer Interaction) typically deals with interactions with computers without social expectations.\n",

    "### Key Landmarks:\n",
    "   - **ASIMO**: A humanoid robot by Honda, represents early advancements in physical robot capabilities.\n",
    "   - **Nao**: A humanoid research platform widely used in HRI.\n",
    "   - **Pepper, Paro, Keepon**: Different forms of robots used for social purposes, ranging from customer service to therapeutic roles."
