    "### **Definition and Scope of HRI**:\n",
    "   - **HRI** focuses on how humans and robots interact, especially with **social robots**, which differ from traditional robots designed for physical tasks.\n",
    "   - Key characteristics of social robots include:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Embodiment:** They often have humanlike features (e.g., eyes, a face).\n",
    "      - **Social skills:** Eye contact, following conversation norms, or recognizing emotions.\n",
    "      - **Influence on human perception:** Their design and appearance (e.g., eyes imply the robot can see).\n"

    "### **History and Evolution of HRI**:\n",
    "   - Mention of **Isaac Asimov** who introduced early ideas about robot-human relationships.\n",
    "   - **Key Milestones**:\n",
    "     - **Kismet (1997)**: One of the first social robots to exhibit emotions and reactions based on input.\n",
    "     - **Nao, Pepper, Paro, Baxter, Cozmo**: Important robots for research in HRI, each with different functions (e.g., therapy, industrial work, social interaction).\n",
    "   \n",
    "### 4. **Physical vs Social Interaction**:\n",
    "   - Physical robots focus on the **manipulation of the environment** (e.g., a robot cleaning a room).\n",
    "   - **Social robots** interact with humans in **social settings**, following rules and understanding behaviors like **eye contact, conversation norms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Human Embodiment and Social Robots**:\n",
    "   - **Embodiment** of a robot (e.g., having eyes, a mouth) influences human interaction and expectations.\n",
    "   - Humanlike features trigger people to treat robots as social beings, but this can lead to frustration if robots donâ€™t meet expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Challenges in HRI**:\n",
    "   - **Technical challenges** arise from needing robots to understand and respond to human behavior.\n",
    "   - **Design challenges** involve making robots visually and behaviorally acceptable in social contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **HRI vs HCI**:\n",
    "   - **HRI** is unique because it deals with **embodied interactions** with robots in the social world, whereas **HCI** (Human-Computer Interaction) typically deals with interactions with computers without social expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Landmarks:\n",
    "   - **ASIMO**: A humanoid robot by Honda, represents early advancements in physical robot capabilities.\n",
    "   - **Nao**: A humanoid research platform widely used in HRI.\n",
    "   - **Pepper, Paro, Keepon**: Different forms of robots used for social purposes, ranging from customer service to therapeutic roles."
