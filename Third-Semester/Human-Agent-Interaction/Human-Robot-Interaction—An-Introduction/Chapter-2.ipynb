    "### **Definition and Scope of HRI**:\n",
    "   - **HRI** focuses on how humans and robots interact, especially with **social robots**, which differ from traditional robots designed for physical tasks.\n",
    "   - Key characteristics of social robots include:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Embodiment:** They often have humanlike features (e.g., eyes, a face).\n",
    "         - **Embodiment** of a robot (e.g., having eyes, a mouth) influences human interaction and expectations.\n",
    "      - **Social skills:** Eye contact, following conversation norms, or recognizing emotions.\n",
    "      - **Influence on human perception:** Their design and appearance (e.g., eyes imply the robot can see).\n",
    "         - Humanlike features trigger people to treat robots as social beings, but this can lead to frustration if robots don’t meet expectations.\n"

    "### **HRI vs HCI**:\n",
    "   - **HRI (Human-Robot Interaction)** focuses on interactions between **humans and physically embodied robots**, dealing with both social and physical interactions, often requiring robots to understand human social cues and norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)** focuses on interactions between **humans and computers** (typically non-embodied systems), primarily involving software, interfaces, and digital environments without the complexities of social embodiment.\n",

    "   - **ASIMO**: A humanoid robot by Honda, represents early advancements in physical robot capabilities.\n",
    "   - **Nao**: A humanoid research platform widely used in HRI.\n",
    "   - **Pepper, Paro, Keepon**: Different forms of robots used for social purposes, ranging from customer service to therapeutic roles.\n",
    "   - **InMoov**: Open-source social robot (2012–present) built with rapid prototyping and accessible components.\n",
    "   - **Blossom**: Open-source tensile robot (2019–present) that can be handcrafted and customized."
