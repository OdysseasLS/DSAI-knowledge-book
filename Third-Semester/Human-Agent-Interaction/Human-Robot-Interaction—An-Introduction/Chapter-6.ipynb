    "#### **Types of Nonverbal Interaction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gaze and Eye Movement**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gesture**:\n",
    "   - Gestures include **deictic (pointing)**, **iconic (illustrating)**, **symbolic (waving)**, and **beat (emphasizing)** movements.\n",
    "   - Robots can use gestures to **enhance communication**, making interactions more **anthropomorphic** and **engaging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mimicry and Imitation**:\n",
    "   - **Mimicry** (unconscious) and **imitation** (conscious) help build rapport and signal **positive interactions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Touch**:\n",
    "   - Examples include therapy robots like **Paro**, which reduce stress through tactile interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Posture and Movement**:\n",
    "   - Body **posture** can signal **emotions** and **engagement** (e.g., upright posture for positivity, drooping for sadness).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rhythm and Timing**:\n",
    "   - **Timing** of nonverbal cues, like gaze or gestures, is essential for **synchronized** interactions (turn-taking, dancing, etc.).\n",
    "   - A robot that mirrors human rhythms during interactions appears more **lifelike** and **engaged**."
